<p>Lysine acetylation and lysine succinylation were two important types of protein post-translation modification, which had been found to play key roles in regulating various protein functions. Although several computational methods had been developed for the prediction of lysine acetylation and lysine succinylation sites, all of these methods only focused on predicting either lysine acetylation sites or lysine succinylation sites and seldom involved the relation between them. In this study, a novel method named PLALS_mouse was proposed to simultaneously predict lysine acetylation sites and lysine succinylation sites in mouse proteins by using composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs and support vector machine. PLALS_mouse achieved a satisfactory performance with a Sensitivity of 77.66%, a Specificity of 67.96%, an Accuracy of 69.09% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.3018 for the prediction of acetylation sites as well as a Sensitivity of 72.38%, a Specificity of 70.94%, an Accuracy of 71.06% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.2609 for the prediction of succinylation sites on training dataset. As illustrated by independent test, PLALS_mouse outperformed existing computational methods for the prediction of lysine acetylation sites and lysine succinylation sites.</p>
